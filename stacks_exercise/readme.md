# Stacks Exercise

For this exercise you must get the tests to pass.

#### Part I 

- Write a constructor function for a `Stack`

Implement the following methods on the `Stack.prototype`

### push

This function adds the value to the beginning of the stack. This should be an O(1) operation and return the size of the stack.

### pop

This function removes the value at the beginning of the stack. This should be an O(1) operation and return the value removed.

### peek

This function returns the first value in the stack.

### print

This function console.log's all the values in the stack.

#### Part II

* Given a doubly linked list, implement a stack
